# Public-projects

## Passage Retrieval project (2024)

* Implemented information retrieval models for passage ranking, progressing from statistical approaches (TF-IDF, BM25) to machine learning-based ranking systems (Logistic Regression, LambdaMART, Neural Networks).
* Engineered a parallelized inverted index and retrieval pipeline, implementing query likelihood models with Laplace, Lidstone, and Dirichlet smoothing to improve ranking effectiveness.
* Leveraged word embeddings to represent queries and passages, enabling the models to enhance passage relevance prediction.
* Trained and evaluated ranking models using standard metrics, optimizing hyperparameters for improved retrieval performance.
* Implemented a neural network ranking model, demonstrating the potential of these architectures for passage retrieval.

## ML Projects

* **AI for Sustainable Development project (2023)** 
    * Analyzed and preprocessed data from the [Womxn in Big Data South Africa Challenge](https://zindi.africa/learn/womxn-in-big-data-south-africa-female-headed-households-in-south-africa-challenge-tutorial)
    * Explored ridge regression, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost for predicting the percentage of female-headed households below an income threshold, and evaluated model interpretability.
* **Analysis of regression approaches (2023)** 
    * Implemented and compared various linear regression techniques, including closed-form solution, gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent. 
    * Implemented ridge regression and optimized the regularization parameter using k-fold cross-validation. 
    * Built regression trees from scratch, optimizing splits using the residual sum of squares and cost-complexity pruning to enhance generalization.

## Communication Protocols projects

* **Router implementation (2021)** – Implemented the data-plane functionality of a router based on a given topology and routing tables, handling ARP and ICMP protocols while optimizing routing decisions for efficiency.
* **Message management with TCP & UDP (2021)** – Developed a client-server application for message passing and subscription using TCP and UDP protocols, implementing connection multiplexing, a custom communication protocol, and a store-and-forward mechanism to ensure message delivery for disconnected clients.
* **Web Client. REST API communication. (2021)** – Developed a C web client to communicate with a REST API, implementing user authentication, session management, and JWT-based access control while handling JSON data.


## Data Analytics App in Haskell (2021)

Developed a Haskell-based data analytics application to process and extract insights from a real-world dataset of student grades, covering tasks such as data cleaning, aggregation, query language design, and graph-based analysis.

## Parallel and Distributed Algorithms projects

* **Parallel documents processing system (2021)** – Implemented a parallel document processing system in Java using the Map-Reduce paradigm to analyse and rank text documents, gaining experience in parallel programming, and algorithm optimization.
* **Collaborative Computation in Distributed Systems (2021)** – Implemented inter-process communication in C using MPI for a predefined three-cluster system, enabling coordination and collaborative task execution through message passing.

## OOP Java projects

* **Store Inventory Management System (2020)** – Developed a system to manage a toy store inventory, implementing CSV data import/export, currency conversion, and discount application, while applying object-oriented principles, design patterns, and exception handling.
